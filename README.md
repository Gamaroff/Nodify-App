Nodify Sample App [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Shopfrogs/Nodify-App.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Shopfrogs/Nodify-App)
======================

This is a Shopify App using Nodify-Shopify module. This app provides the layout and the controllers to show orders and products.

### Installation

    git clone git@github.com:Shopfrogs/Nodify-App.git
    cd Nodify-App
   
Open xx file and declare your API key and Shared Secret. 

If you don't have the API key and Shared Secret yet, sign up for a [Shopify Partner account](https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/signup/), and create your first app. You can also create test stores
once you're logged in as a partner.

When you create your app in the Shopify Partner Account, set the return URL to
<tt>localhost:3000/login/finalize</tt>

Start your local application: 

    node 

Head over to: http://localhost:3000 and enter the url of your Shopify store.

After your application has been given read or read/write API permission by your Shopify store, you're ready to see how Nodify works. It's time to tweak it!
