Nodify Sample App [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Shopfrogs/Nodify-App.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Shopfrogs/Nodify-App)
======================

Besides of hooking up to the whole Shopify API, this connector does authentication for your app with any Shopify store. Billing and sample data is also provided.

### Installation

    # 1
    # 2
    # 3

### Usage

    # 1

If you don't have the API key and Shared Secret yet, sign up for a [Shopify Partner account](https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/signup/), and create your first app. You can also create test stores
once you're logged in as a partner.

When you create your app in the Shopify Partner Account, set the return URL to
<tt>tba</tt>

You can also create a private application that only works for your store by
visiting https://YOUR-SHOP.myshopify.com/admin/api

We deeply explain how to work with Proxy to help Shopify do more brand awareness and to give user a stronger feel that he's working inside his Shopify admin panel. (Carlos, any help?)

### Example

    # 1

This will create the Nodify environment with sample views.

### After running the generator

First, start your application:

    # how to start the node connector

Head over to: http://localhost:3000 (or whichever we call it) and enter the url of your Shopify store.

After your application has been given read or read/write API permission by the
store, you're ready to start experimenting with the Shopify API.
